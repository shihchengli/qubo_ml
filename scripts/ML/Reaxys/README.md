Reaxys is a licensed database provided by Elsevier, so we are unable to provide it. For transparency, we include the reaction IDs (which you can use to rebuild the datasets if you have access to the Reaxys database), along with the data preprocessing script, training scripts, and time comparison scripts used in this work.
